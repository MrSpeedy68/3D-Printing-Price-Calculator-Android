# 3D-Printing-Price-Calculator-Android
Android application for 3D Printing Price calculator

If you sell 3D prints it can be difficult to add up all the numbers constantly to price each individual print with the material costs, printer costs and work hours put into each print you make.

This Android application was created to simplyfy all this work and create a database of Materials and Printers to make each price calculation simple and easy from your smartphone.

This app is still in very early stages. It requires a UI redesign and implementations of certain features like profit margins for materials and other costs.
A Task tab is being implemented with the ability to save an order and the shipping location to be shown on google maps. And the saving of the price to the specified order.
Currently the Database of materials and printers is saved to the device with a saving feature to the cloud using Firebase implemented but needing work to allow users to setup their own firebase account.
